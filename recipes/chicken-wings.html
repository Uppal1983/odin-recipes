        <h2>What This Recipe Is All About!</h2>
        <p>Great for lunch, a barbecue or picnic, these wings have a hint of chilli but are warmly smoky rather than a flaming firecracker.</p>
        <p>Chicken wings consisting of just the wing joint without the tip are best for this dish. Youâ€™ll need to marinate this dish for at least 2 hours before cooking.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1kg/2lb 4oz chicken wings (tips removed)</li>
                <li>1 tbsp light muscovado sugar</li>
                <li>1 tbsp tomato ketchup</li>
                <li>2 tsp sweet smoked paprika</li>
                <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
                <li>1 fresh red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps To Cook</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Put the chicken in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Put the remaining ingredients in another bowl and mix.</li>
                <li>Pour the marinade over the chicken and toss to coat. Cover with cling film and marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
                <li>When you are ready to cook the chicken, preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7 or heat up the barbecue. If you are using a barbecue, allow the flames to flare up and die down until the coals are just glowing before you start to cook the chicken.</li>
                <li>If cooking in the oven, transfer the chicken and marinade into a roasting tin in a single layer. Roast or barbecue for about 30 minutes, turning once halfway through, or until cooked through and a deep golden-brown.</li>
                <li>Serve hot or cold with salad.</li>
            </ol>
