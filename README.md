The Odin Project - Recipes

Simple HTML project which shows several of my favourite foods and recipes which I have shamelessly stolen from the "BBC Food" website :)

I am showcasing everything I've learned thus far:

-Creating boiler template
-Using appropriate headings, paragraphs and text emphasis
-Using lists in both unordered and ordered format
-Using links and images in the HTML page
